    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Forests are the largest terrestrial carbon sinks, playing a critical role in regulating the global carbon cycle through sustained CO$_2$ uptake. However, extreme climate events (such as heatwaves and droughts) can disrupt forest functioning, reducing photosynthetic activity and, in severe cases, causing tree mortality.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in situ measurements provide valuable information on forest health, collecting such data over large areas is costly, time-consuming, and logistically challenging. Scalable and continuous monitoring therefore requires more efficient approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we will explore how to use **Sentinel-2 L2A data stored as Zarr data cubes** to analyze vegetation anomalies in forest ecosystems in Germany. Specifically, we will focus on two ICOS sites affected by the drought of 2018: [DE-Hai](https://meta.icos-cp.eu/resources/stations/ES_DE-Hai) and [DE-Tha](https://meta.icos-cp.eu/resources/stations/ES_DE-Tha), with DE-Tha left for learners to explore on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging **spatiotemporal data cubes**, we will compute spectral indices and derive anomaly time series to evaluate forest responses to extreme events in CO$_2$ uptake (Gross Primary Production, GPP, from ICOS). This notebook will guide you through a **modular workflow** for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accessing Sentinel-2 Zarr data from STAC.  \n",
    "2. Calculating vegetation indices.  \n",
    "3. Detecting anomalies in time series.  \n",
    "4. Visualizing forest responses to environmental extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this study case, you will see the potential of **Zarr-based data cubes** for scalable forest monitoring."
