    "Water reservoirs are essential for water supply, energy production, and irrigation. However, population growth, economic expansion, and climate change are increasing pressure on these resources, affecting water availability and raising the risk of droughts and floods. Reliable monitoring of reservoirs is critical to ensure sustainable water management and water security. This is especially important in transboundary basins, where upstream reservoirs can significantly influence water availability for downstream countries.\n",

It provides near-real-time (NRT), globally accessible information on reservoirs using Earth Observation data, helping stakeholders monitor changes in water extent and manage resources more effectively. A detailed description of the GWW methods is available under *High-resolution surface water dynamics in Earth’s small and medium-sized reservoirs* by Donchyts et al., [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17074-6).  \n",

    "First, we identify edges in the NDWI image using the `Canny`, which highlights sharp transitions between water and land. After that, we apply a `morphological dilation` to the edges, and using only these dilated edge pixels, we apply `Otsu thresholding` to determine a robust cutoff value that separates water from land. This avoids biases from large uniform land areas and ensures the threshold is focused on transition zones. For more details on the Canny edge detector and Otsu thresholding see this [publication](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/5/386).\n",

Water is added in areas that are classified as non-water (NDWI<0 here, -0.15 in raw GWW) but exceed the WO threshold.\n",

    "### Task 3 (advanced): Explore water extent estimation with SAR Sentinel-1 Level-1 GRD\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**  \n",
    "Adapt the detection workflow you developed for Sentinel-2 optical data to **Sentinel-1 SAR** data, and compare how it performs for the same reservoir.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we used **Sentinel-2 L1C optical data** to estimate reservoir surface area. The same logic - *Otsu thresholding*, *edge detection*, *morphological filtering*, and *largest connected component extraction* - can also be applied to **Sentinel-1 SAR** data. Since SAR measures **backscatter** instead of reflectance, we can’t compute spectral indices like NDWI. Instead, we use the backscatter values directly to separate wet and dry pixels: water usually appears **dark (e.g. < −16 dB)**. SAR has the advantage of being **cloud-independent**, but can sometimes overestimate water, especially when **dry soil** also produces low backscatter. Also note that SAR requires preprocessing before using it like orbit correction, thermal noise removal, calibration, speckle filtering, terrain correction, conversion to dB etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and preprocess Sentinel-1 GRD data (see the Flood Mapping - Time Series Analysis in Valencia example).  \n",
    "2. Adjust the gww function to work with SAR, e.g. apply a simple mask (e.g. `backscatter < -16`), refine with **Otsu thresholding**, use existing morphological steps to clean the result and extract the reservoir (you can skip the water occurrence filling).\n",
    "3. Compare the SAR-based water area with your Sentinel-2 estimates.\n"
